Explanation
--
A supermoon occurred yesterday. And tonight's moon should also look impressive.  Supermoons appear slightly larger and brighter than most full moons because they reach their full phase when slightly nearer to the Earth -- closer than 90 percent of all full moons.  This supermoon was also a blue moon given the definition that it is the third of four full moons occurring during a single season.  Blue moons are not usually blue, and a different definition holds that a blue moon is the second full moon that occurs during a single month.  The featured image captured the blue supermoon right near its peak size yesterday as it was rising beyond the Temple of Poseidon in Greece. This supermoon is particularly unusual in that it is the first of four successive supermoons, the next three occurring in September, October, and November.
